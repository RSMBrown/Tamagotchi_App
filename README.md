Tamagotchi

In the early 2000's, Tamagotchis were all the rage. They were handheld, digital pets that could be carried around on keychain-sized mini computers. They required loving care by pressing buttons to feed them, play with them, and put them to sleep. If you didn't give a Tamagotchi enough food, attention or rest, it would...alas...die.
Time for you to make your own Tamagotchis! Think through how a Tamagotchi works. What properties does every Tamagotchi have when it is created? What levels will need to be maintained to care for your Tamagotchi? How will you manage the passing of time and the changing of those levels? How do those levels increase? When do they decrease? After brainstorming the behaviors you want to capture in your Tamagotchi game, get started writing specs for unit testing your class methods.
Here are some possible behaviors you may consider for your Tamagotchi. As you work through this list, feel free to add additional types of interactions a user may have with their Tamagotchi, too.
* Check on the pet and see how it's doing — is it still alive?!?
* Feed it
* Play with it
* Put it to sleep

Further Exploration
If you've completed all Tamagotchi functionality with time to spare, add support for multiple Tamagotchis. The home page should list all Tamagotchi names, and users should be able to click on a Tamagotchi to see a detail view page with that pet's information and levels. Make sure to include integration testing for these new 'paths' users can travel.
For the time being, it's fine if time only passes and depletes Tamagotchi levels while a user is viewing an individual Tamagotchi.
